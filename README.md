# PHP version transpile
This is a simple utility that accepts a directory structure containing php 7.4 typed property classes and copies this
structure to the specified output folder with the typed properties commented out. It does the same in reverse. 

```Usage: ./bin/transpile PHP_VERSION SOURCE_DIR DEST_DIR```
```Example: ./bin/transpile 7.3 ./src ./dist```
